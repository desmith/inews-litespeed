= Why we made Charitable =

We built Charitable because we were tired of seeing non-profits use hosted fundraising platforms that charge hefty fees and strip them of the ability to brand & control their donation pages. Other WordPress donation plugins existed, but they missed important functionality or were poorly supported, leaving non-profits to choose between expensive platforms or plugins lacking the features they really needed.

So we created & launched Charitable in 2015 as a feature-rich, affordable WordPress alternative to hosted fundraising platforms. Four years on, we still actively develop and support Charitable, which is trusted by over 10,000 non-profits all over the world.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I accept donations directly on my site? =

Yes you can! If you use PayPal, donors will be redirected to PayPal to complete their donation. However, you can use the Offline Donations gateway to allow your donors to create a donation and make the payment via cheque or bank transfer (you can display your payment details to them).

Better yet, let your donors make credit card donations directly on your WordPress website with the following payment gateway extensions:

* [Stripe](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-stripe/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Plugin+Readme+Stripe+Link&utm_campaign=Charitable&utm_content=Stripe)
* [Braintree](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-braintree/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Plugin+Readme+Braintree+Link&utm_campaign=Charitable&utm_content=Braintree)
* [Authorize.net](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-authorize-net/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Plugin+Readme+Authorize+Net+Link&utm_campaign=Charitable&utm_content=Authorize.net)
